sherpa
sherpa
sherpa

only way's up
laid with ice
getting - worn out 
daily sacrifice's callin' 
ya better - own that                      (own that - scream add)
only way's now                            (only time's now)
throws of dice
pressin' onwards 
always lucking out
sherpa's gone now                         (onwards adds)

gettin' all the slots 
for a mission
pushin' them ladders - vain 
for a reason
off the tones of crowd 
so gleeful                                (scream add gleeful)
eyes on the                               (deeper voice)
mists of the frozen                       (deeper voice)
at this ungodly hour 
the unskilled will devour
the rest


you better hold on to my crest
hayanna

sherpa's making 
safe passage

lives are at stake

## Music Video


## Notes
+ Thinking about adding like local nepal melodies or tibetan humming in the background.
+ lives are at stake (crowd chant purpose)
+ ask the crowd to start tibetan hum before the song starts (impact)

Mountains await
Mountains of height 
But I will see the light



sherpas (mountain workers) vs Sherpas (ethnic group)
capitonym - words changing meaning based on their capitalization
notorious area - Kun Bu Icefall
40 times a day
buried beneath
crevice, cargo 
most dangerous job on earth
